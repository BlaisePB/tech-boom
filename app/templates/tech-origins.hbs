  <h1>Tech and its origins in the US</h1>

  <p>From Benjamin Franklin experiments with electricity in the 1700â€™s, to the invention of the first telephone call in 1876, to the many devices we have today. All these events have helped become a society that depends on technology for thongs like business and communication. The first computer, the ENIAC, was built in 1946 and weighed around 50 tons. Only a handful of people were allowed to use this machine. Today, however, over 1 billion people have cellphones, and unlike the ENIAC these devices only weigh about 6 ounces and can fit in your pocket. Today we rely on technology for almost everything we do, whether it's making a call, scrolling through social media in our free time, or shopping online, technology is apart of our everyday life. And our tech is only getting better and faster.</p>
